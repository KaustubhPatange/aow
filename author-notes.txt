- Two github actions are currently configured.
- CD
    - This CI will create a new github release by building all the required binaries for all platforms.
- RELEASE
    - This CI will push a new release package to chocolatey & cargo.

A discord message will be send to the author's private server for every CI successful build with some
private variables to perform other actions.

You must manually publish new release package to Homebrew (repo exist at adb-over-wifi/homebrew-aow).
